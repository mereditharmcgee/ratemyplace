        <p class="mb-3">When you submit a review or other content to RateMyPlace, you understand and agree that:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Your reviews represent your personal opinions</strong> based on your individual experience as a tenant. Reviews are subjective assessments, not verified statements of fact.</li>
          <li><strong>You are solely responsible</strong> for the content of your reviews. RateMyPlace does not adopt, endorse, or verify user-submitted content.</li>
          <li><strong>You must have actually lived</strong> at the property you are reviewing. Submitting reviews for properties where you have not resided is a violation of these terms.</li>
          <li><strong>You grant RateMyPlace a license</strong> to display, distribute, and use your submitted content in connection with operating the platform.</li>
          <li><strong>Your review may be identifiable</strong> to landlords or property managers based on details you provide, even without your name attached. You acknowledge this risk when submitting.</li>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Platform Role & Safe Harbor</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">RateMyPlace operates as a neutral platform for tenant reviews:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>We provide a venue for tenants to share their rental experiences but do not create, verify, or endorse the content of reviews.</li>
          <li>We are not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any user-submitted content.</li>
          <li>As an interactive computer service provider, we are protected under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and are not treated as the publisher of user-generated content.</li>
          <li>We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor, edit, or remove content at our sole discretion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Content Moderation</h2>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Landlord Response System:</strong> Property owners may submit responses to reviews, which will be displayed alongside the original review.</li>
          <li><strong>Report Violations:</strong> Reviews that contain false statements of fact, personal information, or other guideline violations may be reported for review by our moderation team.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Disputes:</strong> Legal disputes regarding review content should be directed to the review author. As a neutral platform, RateMyPlace does not adjudicate factual disputes between tenants and landlords.</li>
