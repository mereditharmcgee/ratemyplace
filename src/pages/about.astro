      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8">
        RateMyPlace is a tenant-focused platform that helps renters make informed decisions
        about their next home by providing honest, verified reviews from real tenants.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        Finding a good apartment is challenging. Beyond high rents and competitive markets,
        tenants often don't know what they're getting into until they've signed a lease. We believe
        every renter deserves access to honest information about buildings and landlords before making
        one of their biggest financial decisions.
      </p>
